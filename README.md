                                            Welcome to my GitHub repository!    
         Here, I have a special project that makes organizing your digital files a breeze. 
With my Python program, you can say goodbye to messy folders and hello to order. It automatically sorts your images, audio files, 
videos, and documents into neat folders, saving you time and effort. This project uses the OS module to make everything super easy.
So, come and check it out! Let's simplify and revolutionize how we manage our digital lives together!
